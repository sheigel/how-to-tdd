> "How do you know that the code you've just written does what you think it does?
You could just not care and commit it without making sure. Besides not being a professional it just ensures that in 1-2h's time you'll have to stop your progress on a new functionality and get back to fixing the bugs reported. This is the easiest way to greatly lower the value of our time and of our colleagues time. It makes no sense to not verify our work. It's like digging ditches by throwing earth either in someone else's ditch or behind us in our own ditch." - A Great Man
